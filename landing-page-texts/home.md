## Problem Section

### Section Title
The Problem: Google Optimizes for Clicks, Not Revenue

### Problem Statements
- 90% of ad tracking data is lost due to cookie restrictions and privacy changes
- Google Ads sees your cheap lead forms as "conversions" and optimizes for them
- You can't tell Google which leads turned into actual customers with revenue

### Industry Data Callout
Industry data shows advertisers who implement offline conversion tracking and value-based bidding often achieve 20-50% better efficiency. AdVocate makes that setup achievable for small teams.

## How It Works Section

### Section Title
How Server-Side Attribution Works

### Section Subtitle
Built server-side on Cloudflare's edge, so conversions survive cookie loss, ad blockers and buggy browser tracking.

### Step 1
**Click Captured**
GCLID parameter captured on your website and stored at server level.

### Step 2
**Revenue Connected**
GoHighLevel, Shopify, or form data arrives via webhook—lead values, deal stages, orders.

### Step 3
**Offline Conversions**
Google Ads & Meta receive server-side conversions with that revenue attached, optimizing for customers.

---

## Key Capabilities

### GCLID Preservation
Capture and store GCLIDs/UTMs at server level, then use them later when a lead turns into revenue to create accurate offline conversions in Google Ads.

### Universal Integration
Connect GoHighLevel workflows, Shopify orders or any custom form via webhook. We turn those events—won deals, high-value customers, subscriptions—into Google Ads / Meta CAPI conversions with value attached.

### Revenue-Aware Conversions
Send purchase amounts, pipeline values or LTV back to ad platforms so bidding algorithms learn which clicks become your best customers, not just any lead.

## Industry Results

## The Attribution Gap Section

### Section Title
The Shopify + GHL Attribution Gap

### Shopify Attribution Problems
- iOS 14.5+ blocks third-party cookies, losing 20-30% of attribution data
- Server-side tracking is complex to set up with GTM containers
- Offline conversions require manual CSV uploads or complex API calls
- Revenue values from orders don't automatically flow back to Google Ads

### GHL Attribution Challenges
- Lead forms work great, but attribution data stops at the CRM
- Google Ads sees "form submissions" but not actual customer value
- Deal stages and pipeline values stay trapped in the CRM
- Agencies lose 20-30% of ad spend attribution across all campaigns

### The Hidden Cost
For a Shopify agency spending €10,000/mo on Google Ads, losing 20-30% attribution means €2,000-3,000 of ad spend is wasted every month. That's €24,000-36,000 annually of unoptimized, untracked ad dollars.
