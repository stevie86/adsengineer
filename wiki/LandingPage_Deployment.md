# Landing Page Deployment Guide

This guide describes how to deploy the AdsEngineer Landing Page (located in `landing-page/`).

## Project Type
The landing page is built with **Astro**. It creates a static site that is highly optimized for performance.

## Option 1: Cloudflare Pages (Recommended)
Cloudflare Pages is the easiest and most performant way to deploy Astro sites. It offers a global CDN, free SSL, and automatic deployments from Git.

### Prerequisites
- Cloudflare account
- GitHub account connected to Cloudflare

### Steps
1. Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2. Log in to the Cloudflare Dashboard.
3. Go to **Workers & Pages** > **Create Application** > **Pages** > **Connect to Git**.
4. Select your repository (`ads-engineer`).
5. Configure the build settings:
   - **Framework Preset:** `Astro`
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Build Output Directory:** `dist`
   - **Root Directory:** `landing-page` (Important! Since the project is in a subdirectory)
6. Click **Save and Deploy**.

Cloudflare will verify the build and give you a live URL (e.g., `adsengineer-landing.pages.dev`).

## Option 2: VPS / Froxlor (Nginx/Apache)
If you prefer to host it on your own server (e.g., alongside the Calculator App), you can deploy the static files generated by the build process.

### Steps
1. **Build the project locally:**
   ```bash
   cd landing-page
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
   This will create a `dist/` directory containing HTML, CSS, and JS files.

2. **Upload to Server:**
   Use SCP or FTP to upload the contents of the `dist/` folder to your server's web root (e.g., `/var/www/adsengineer.com/`).
   ```bash
   scp -r dist/* user@your-server:/var/www/adsengineer.com/
   ```

3. **Configure Froxlor/Nginx:**
   - Ensure the domain points to that directory.
   - Nginx configuration is standard for static sites. Ensure `index.html` is the index file.
   - **Important for Subpages:** If you have multiple pages, ensure Nginx is configured to handle clean URLs if needed (though default Astro builds usually work fine with standard storage).

## Option 3: Netlify / Vercel
Similar to Cloudflare Pages, these platforms have zero-config support for Astro.

1. Import project from Git.
2. Set **Root Directory** to `landing-page`.
3. The Build Command (`npm run build`) and Output Directory (`dist`) should be detected automatically.
