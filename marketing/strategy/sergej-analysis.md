# Strategic Analysis: The Sergej (onlineseitig) Situation

## 1. The Situation Assessment
- **The Good:** You identified a real bug (broken booking process). This builds credibility.
- **The Bad:** Sergej is likely stressed/busy (fixing a month-long bug is high pressure) and perceived your suggestion as a "sales pitch" during a crisis.
- **The Objection:** "He'd reach out if needed" is a classic "polite no" to end the conversation.

## 2. Should you send the one-pager?
**Yes, but with a "Permissionless Value" approach.** 

Do NOT send it as a "pitch." Send it as a "resource" that helps him solve the problem he's currently dealing with. 

**The Frame:** "I know you're busy fixing the booking flow, so I put this together to help your team ensure that once it's fixed, the data actually reaches your ad platforms. No need to reply."

## 3. Recommended Approach (The "No-Ask" Email)

**Subject:** Resource for your team: Attribution integrity for the booking fix

Hi Sergej,

Totally understand you're busy getting the booking process back on track. 

Since Stefan mentioned the AdBlocker/Attribution issue, I put together a quick **Technical Brief** (attached) for your dev team. It explains how to ensure those bookings are actually tracked correctly once the flow is live, especially for users on Safari or using AdBlockers.

No need to jump on a call or even reply to this. Just wanted to make sure you had the technical specs in case it helps the fix.

Best,
[Your Name]

## 4. Why this works
- **Low Friction:** You explicitly say "No need to reply" and "No call needed." This lowers his guard.
- **Expert Positioning:** You aren't a "salesperson"; you're a "technical resource."
- **Reciprocity:** You gave him a bug report for free. Now you're giving him a technical brief for free.
- **Timing:** When the booking bug is fixed, his next problem will be "Why aren't our ad results showing these bookings?" He will remember your brief.

## 5. When to follow up
- **Wait 7-10 days.** 
- Check if the booking process is fixed (test it yourself).
- **Follow-up message:** "Glad to see the booking flow is back up! I noticed it's working smoothly now. Did the team have any questions about the server-side tracking brief I sent over? We're seeing about 40% more data capture with that setup."

## 6. Alternative Approach: The "Audit"
If he still doesn't bite, offer a **"Silent Audit."** 
"If you're curious about the data gap, I can run a 24-hour comparison between your server logs and your Meta Pixel. It takes 5 minutes to set up and will show you exactly how many conversions you're currently missing. No cost, just data."
