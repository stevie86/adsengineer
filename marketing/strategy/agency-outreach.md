# Agency Outreach Strategy: The "Data Recovery" Partner Program

## 1. The Value Proposition for Agencies
Agencies care about two things: **Client Results** and **Operational Efficiency**.
- **Results:** Recovering 40% of data makes the agency look like heroes. ROAS goes up without changing a single ad creative.
- **Efficiency:** AdsEngineer handles the technical headache of Meta CAPI and Google SST, so the agency's media buyers don't have to.

## 2. Email Template: The "Attribution Audit" Angle
**Subject:** Quick question about [Client Name]'s attribution gap

Hi [Name],

I’ve been following [Agency Name]’s work with [Client/Industry]—really impressive results.

I’m reaching out because we’ve noticed a consistent trend with agencies in the [Industry] space: they’re typically losing about 40% of their conversion data due to iOS 14.5 and AdBlockers. This usually means their Meta/Google ROAS is under-reporting by at least 20-30%.

We built **AdsEngineer** to fix this. It’s a server-side tracking hub that restores that missing data in about 5 minutes.

Would you be open to a "Data Leak Audit" for one of your clients? We can show you exactly how much data is currently falling through the cracks—no strings attached.

Best,
[Your Name]

## 3. LinkedIn Approach: The "Technical Partner" Angle
**Connection Request:**
"Hi [Name], love the work [Agency Name] is doing. I’m working on a server-side tracking solution that’s helping agencies recover ~40% of lost conversion data from iOS/Safari. Would love to connect and share what we’re seeing in the market."

**Follow-up (after connection):**
"Thanks for connecting, [Name]. Most agencies we talk to are struggling with 'dark conversions' where Shopify shows a sale but Meta shows nothing. We’ve built a 5-minute fix for this that moves tracking to the server. 

If you’re dealing with attribution headaches for your clients, I’d love to send over a one-pager on how we’re automating the fix. Worth a look?"

## 4. Follow-up Sequence
- **Day 1:** Initial Outreach (Email or LinkedIn).
- **Day 4:** Follow-up with a specific case study or "Did you know?" fact about Safari ITP.
- **Day 10:** The "Break-up" email: "I assume attribution isn't a priority right now. I'll check back in a few months. In the meantime, here's a link to our technical docs if your team ever needs a reference for server-side tracking."
