## Product Overview
**One-liner:** Recover 40% of lost conversion data with enterprise-grade server-side tracking.
**What it does:** AdsEngineer bypasses browser-side limitations (iOS 14.5+, Safari ITP, AdBlockers) by moving tracking from the client's browser to a secure server-side environment, ensuring 100% accurate attribution.
**Product category:** Server-Side Tracking (SST) / Attribution Software
**Product type:** B2B SaaS
**Business model:** Tiered Subscription (Starter/Growth/Enterprise)

## Target Audience
**Target companies:** E-commerce brands, B2B SaaS, Lead Gen businesses, Healthcare (HIPAA), Publishers.
**Decision-makers:** Marketing Directors, CMOs, Agency Owners, E-commerce Managers, Data Analysts.
**Primary use case:** Fixing broken attribution and "dark" conversions caused by privacy updates.
**Jobs to be done:**
- "Help me see which ads are actually driving sales."
- "Stop my ad platforms from over-optimizing for the wrong users due to missing data."
- "Ensure GDPR compliance without losing all my tracking capabilities."

## Problems & Pain Points
**Core problem:** 40% of conversion data is "leaking" due to iOS 14.5, Safari ITP, and AdBlockers.
**Why alternatives fall short:** Standard browser-side pixels (Meta Pixel, GA4) are easily blocked or stripped of cookies by modern browsers.
**What it costs them:** Inflated CPA (Cost Per Acquisition), wasted ad spend on non-performing campaigns, and incorrect business scaling decisions.
**Emotional tension:** Frustration with "black box" ad platforms and the feeling of flying blind despite spending thousands on ads.

## Differentiation
**Key differentiators:**
- 5-minute setup for WordPress/Shopify.
- First-party data ownership (GDPR compliant by design).
- Multi-platform hub (Google, Meta, TikTok, GA4).
- Closed-loop attribution.
**How we do it differently:** We move the tracking logic to a Cloudflare Worker environment (Server-Side), making it invisible to ad blockers and immune to browser cookie restrictions.

## Customer Language
**How they describe the problem:**
- "My Facebook ROAS looks terrible but my Shopify sales are fine—I don't know what's working."
- "AdBlockers are killing my tracking."
- "iOS 14 destroyed our attribution."
**Words to use:** Data recovery, attribution accuracy, ROAS boost, first-party data, server-side.
**Words to avoid:** Pixel (unless referring to the old way), workaround, bypass (use "recover" or "restore" for better compliance tone).

## Brand Voice
**Tone:** Professional, authoritative, technical but accessible.
**Style:** Direct, value-first, data-driven.
**Personality:** The "Engineer" who fixes the marketing leak.

## Proof Points
**Metrics:** 40% average data recovery; 15-20% improvement in ROAS within 30 days.
**Setup:** 5-minute integration for major platforms.
