# 🎯 FOCUSED INTEGRATION ROADMAP - 80/20 RULE

## ✅ **SMART FOCUS: Core Platforms Only**

**You're absolutely right - ignore page builders like Divi, Elementor, etc. Focus on the platforms that actually matter for lead generation and conversion tracking.**

---

## **🎯 TARGET PLATFORMS (High Impact, High Value)**

### **1. WordPress Core + WooCommerce (PRIMARY TARGET)**
- ✅ **WordPress CMS**: 40% of websites - MASSIVE opportunity
- ✅ **WooCommerce**: 20% of e-commerce - Direct Shopify competitor
- ❌ **Ignore**: Divi, Elementor, Beaver Builder, page builders

**Why?** Page builders don't affect lead generation - they're just design tools. Focus on the CMS that hosts the websites.

### **2. Major CRM Platforms (SECONDARY TARGET)**
- ✅ **HubSpot**: Enterprise favorite, high-ticket clients
- ✅ **ActiveCampaign**: Email marketing leader
- ✅ **Mailchimp**: 15M+ users, easy integration
- ✅ **GoHighLevel**: Already supported
- ❌ **Ignore**: Advanced CRM features, custom fields, etc.

**Why?** CRMs handle the leads - that's your core business.

### **3. Advertising Platforms (THIRD TARGET)**
- ✅ **Google Ads**: Already supported
- ✅ **Facebook Ads**: Next priority
- ✅ **LinkedIn Ads**: Enterprise focus
- ❌ **Ignore**: Ad creative tools, campaign builders

**Why?** Ads drive the traffic - attribution is your value prop.
