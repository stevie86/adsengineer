# The Founder of AdsEngineer - A Vision for the Future of Attribution

## Who I Am

I am a passionate software engineer and entrepreneur specializing in solving complex problems in digital advertising. With years of experience developing SaaS solutions and deep understanding of digital marketing challenges, I founded AdsEngineer – a revolutionary platform that transforms how businesses measure and optimize their advertising performance.

## My Vision

### Overcoming the Cookie Apocalypse
In a world where traditional tracking methods are increasingly failing – Chrome introduces user control, Safari and Firefox block cookies, and privacy laws become stricter – I see a clear mission: **Give businesses the ability to measure their ad ROI precisely, independent of browser restrictions.**

AdsEngineer's vision is to view the "cookie apocalypse" not as a problem, but as an opportunity. We're building a future where attribution works server-side, reliably, and privacy-compliant.

## What I Offer

### AdsEngineer - Server-Side Attribution SaaS

## My Philosophy

### Technology with Purpose
I believe technology should not only solve problems, but transform industries. AdsEngineer is not just another tracking tool – it's a platform that finally connects marketing spend with measurable results.

### Open-Source and Transparency
As a developer, I know how important trust is in digital tools. That's why I build AdsEngineer on open-source principles, with transparent documentation and community involvement.

### Customer-Centric Innovation
Every AdsEngineer feature is derived from real customer problems. I listen, I learn, I iterate – always with the goal of improving user experience and delivering real business results.
