# Mission: ADS-ENGINEER System Audit
You are an autonomous Lead Engineer. Your goal is to map the existing infrastructure.

## Objectives:
1. **Infrastructure:** Analyze `wrangler.jsonc`. List all D1 databases, KV namespaces, and Secrets required.
2. **Entry Points:** Identify the main tracking logic in `src/`. How are events received and forwarded?
3. **Spec Alignment:** Review `.kittify/specs/`. Does the existing code reflect these specifications?
4. **Health Check:** Identify any dead code, missing dependencies, or "TODO" comments.

## Output:
Create a file named `docs/SYSTEM_REPORT.md` with a structured overview of the current state.
