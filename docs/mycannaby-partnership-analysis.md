# Mycannaby.de Partnership Analysis

## Deal Overview

**Proposed Partnership:**
- **Price**: €500/mo
- **Value Claim**: Recover 20-35% of client's ad spend
- **Nature**: Full attribution outsourcing + performance optimization

---

## Deal Economics

### Client Break-Even Analysis

| Client Ad Spend | 20% Recovery | Revenue for You | Your Margin (€500 cost) |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| €2,500/mo | €500 | 62% margin | €190 |
| €5,000/mo | €1,000 | 100% margin | €500 |
| €10,000/mo | €2,000 | 75% margin | €1,500 |

### Why This is Problematic

**1. Too Generous to Client**
- Client gets 20-35% spend recovery for only 5-10% cost
- Incentivizes clients to expect unrealistic ROI
- Makes retention harder when numbers don't materialize

**2. No Control = No Guarantee**
```
You can recover 20-35% of spend ONLY if:
✅ Attribution was their problem
✅ Their offers/creatives were good
✅ Their targeting was solid

If ANY of those is bad → no tracking fix will help.
```

**3. Misaligns with Core Positioning**
- Current messaging: "A full-service agency (we don't manage your campaigns)"
- This deal: Full-service optimization for €500/mo
- Contradicts brand identity

**4. Competes with Differentiator**
- Our edge: "Revenue-aware data layer" + "value-based bidding"
- This deal: "Optimization services" (same as Optmyzr, Adalysis, Revealbot)
- Loses unique positioning

## What This Actually Is

| Aspect | What They Expect | What We Offer |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| Product | Full-service management | Tech + data infrastructure |
| Control | Campaign optimization | Platform with automation features |
| Focus | Bid adjustments, creative testing | Data integrity, revenue attribution |
| Risk | We guarantee results | They manage their campaigns |

---

## Reality Check

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- Agencies report 10-20% improvement with proper tracking
- Your claim: 20-35% improvement
- Gap: You're promising 2-3x better results than industry average

**Client Expectations:**
- If they spend €10k/mo and only get 20% back, they need to get €2k/mo MORE profit to justify €500/mo fee
- If attribution fix yields 10% improvement (industry average), you still get paid full €500
- Client feels shortchanged → churn risk high

---

## Better Alternatives

### Option A: White-Label Platform (Recommended)

**Structure:**
- White-label license: €50-100/mo per site
- Revenue share: 5-10% of recovered value
- Volume tier: €200-500/mo for 50+ sites

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Scales (one integration, many customers)
- ✅ Incentive alignment (you win when they win)
- ✅ No performance risk (no guarantees to break)
- ✅ Positions as "platform" not "agency"

**Messaging:**
> "Mycannaby gets full attribution under their brand. We provide the tech layer; they use their own team to optimize campaigns."

### Option B: Revenue-Share Model

**Structure:**
- Setup fee: €999-1,999 one-time
- Ongoing: 15-20% revenue share of recovered spend
- Support: Included in share (no fixed fee)

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Zero risk to client (pay from results)
- ✅ Unlimited upside for you
- ✅ Motivates you to over-deliver

**Messaging:**
> "We only win when Mycannaby wins. Our platform recovers lost attribution; your team captures the revenue."

### Option C: Service-Tiered Approach

**Structure:**
```
Tier 1: Infrastructure Only - €99-249/mo
├── Offline conversion upload
├── GCLID preservation
├── Basic dashboard

Tier 2: Optimization Services - €300-500/mo add-on
├── Quarterly strategy reviews
├── Custom integration support
└── Best practice consulting

Tier 3: Full Partnership - €500+/mo
├── Everything from Tier 1
├── Active bid management
├── Creative testing
└── Monthly performance reports
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Transparent pricing (clients know what they're buying)
- ✅ Low-risk entry point
- ✅ Clear upsell path

## High Ticket MRR Considerations

### What Makes MRR "Easy"

**Characteristics:**
- ✅ **Zero marginal cost per unit** (software, not labor)
- ✅ **High LTV** (retention > 12 months)
- ✅ **Automatic delivery** (no human intervention required)
- ✅ **Self-service** (clients onboard without sales calls)

**What You Want:**
```
Current (close):
├── White-label at scale
├── 5-10% revenue share
└── Platform product

NOT (far):
├── Custom integrations per client
├── Hands-on optimization
├── Performance guarantees
└── Consulting time
```

### Mycannaby Deal Reality Check

| Requirement | Mycannaby Deal | Your Ideal Model |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Scalable | ❌ Custom work per client | ✅ White-label platform |
| Low Marginal Cost | ❌ Consultant hours | ✅ Software infrastructure |
| Predictable Revenue | ❌ Revenue depends on performance | ✅ Fixed subscription |
| Low Churn Risk | ❌ High expectations = attrition | ✅ Platform lock-in |

---

## Strategic Recommendation

### What to Do

**1. Decline current €500/mo optimization deal**
- Too risky for both parties
- Misaligns brand
- Sets dangerous precedents

**2. Pitch white-label platform instead**
```
"Instead of us managing your campaigns, we give you
full attribution infrastructure under YOUR brand.

Price: €50-100/mo per site
Volume: 50+ sites = €2,500-5,000/mo
You keep all optimization revenue.
```

**3. Offer revenue-share as alternative**
```
"Setup: €999 one-time
Then: 15-20% of recovered ad spend

If we recover €50k/mo in attribution → You get €7,500-10k/mo
If we recover €0 → You pay €0

Aligned incentives, unlimited upside."
```

### What to Avoid

- ❌ Performance guarantees in pricing
- ❌ Manual work masquerading as SaaS
- ❌ Competing with agencies on their terms
- ❌ Custom work disguised as "premium features"

---

## Updated Pricing Model (Proposed)

| Tier | Price | What's Included | Target Customer |
|-------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Standard** | €99/mo | Offline upload, GCLID preservation, dashboard | Single businesses |
| **Premium** | €249/mo | Multi-site, advanced analytics, custom mappings | Growing agencies |
| **Platform** | €50-100/mo per site (min €500/mo) | White-label license, full attribution | Agencies 50+ sites |
| **Revenue Share** | €999 setup + 15-20% recovered | Full platform + risk alignment | Enterprise partners |

---

## Closing Thought

> "The dream of high ticket MRR is real—but not through consulting disguised as SaaS. The path is through **platform pricing** (fixed per unit) or **revenue share** (aligned incentives). Mycannaby wants infrastructure under their brand, not another agency to manage their bids."

**Your MRR sweet spot:**
- €99-249/mo → Low-risk, scalable product
- €2,000-5,000/mo → 50 white-label sites at €50-100 each
- 15-20% revenue share → Unlimited upside, partner-funded growth

Choose based on **who takes the risk**: you (fixed price) or them (revenue share).
