# AdVocate Sales Playbook

## The One-Liner

> **"AdVocate tells Google which of your leads actually made you money – so your ads find more customers like them, automatically."**

---

## The 30-Second Pitch

> "Right now, Google treats all your leads the same. The $20,000 case and the tire-kicker cost you the same to acquire. That's insane.
>
> AdVocate fixes that. When a lead becomes a customer, we tell Google exactly how much they were worth. Google's AI then hunts for more people just like them.
>
> Our clients typically see 30-50% better results within 90 days – not because we're smarter than Google, but because we give Google smarter data.
>
> Want to see how it works?"

---

## The 2-Minute Pitch

> "Let me ask you something: When someone fills out a form on your website, can you tell which Google ad brought them there?"
>
> *[Wait for answer – usually "sort of" or "no"]*
>
> "And when that lead becomes a customer – maybe weeks or months later – does that information ever get back to Google?"
>
> *[Almost always "no"]*
>
> "That's the problem. Google is flying blind. It sees clicks and form fills, but it has no idea which clicks turn into real money. So it optimizes for... clicks and form fills. Not revenue.
>
> AdVocate closes that loop.
>
> Here's how it works:
>
> **Step 1:** We install a small plugin on your website. Takes 10 minutes. It captures exactly which ad brought each visitor.
>
> **Step 2:** When they fill out a form or call, we create a lead record with all that tracking data attached.
>
> **Step 3:** When that lead becomes a customer, we tell Google: 'Hey, this click from this keyword at this time turned into a $15,000 customer.'
>
> **Step 4:** Google's AI goes, 'Oh interesting, let me find more people like that.' And it does.
>
> The result? Our clients typically see cost per acquisition drop 30-50% within the first 90 days. Not because we're running their ads differently – but because Google finally has the data it needs to run them intelligently.
>
> We also automate a bunch of the tedious stuff – budget adjustments, pausing underperformers, alerting you when something's wrong – so you're not babysitting campaigns all day.
>
> Does this sound like something that could help your business?"

## Handling Objections

### "We already have an agency"

> "That's great – and we can actually make your agency more effective. Here's a question: Ask them if they're uploading offline conversions with value adjustments based on lead quality. If they're not – and most aren't – they're leaving 30-40% of your potential results on the table.
>
> AdVocate can work alongside your agency. In fact, some agencies use us as their secret weapon. Would it be worth a conversation with them about adding this to your setup?"

---

### "We tried Google Ads before and it didn't work"

> "I hear that a lot. And usually it's not that Google Ads doesn't work – it's that the tracking was broken.
>
> Think about it: If you can't see which ads actually brought in customers – not just clicks, but actual revenue – how can you improve? You're basically flying blind.
>
> That's exactly what AdVocate fixes. We connect the dots between ad click and customer. When you can see the full picture, optimization becomes obvious.
>
> Would you be open to a free audit? I can show you exactly what's broken in 15 minutes – no commitment."

---

### "It's too expensive"

> "Let's run the numbers together. You're spending $X on ads right now. What if we could improve your results by just 20%? That's $Y in additional revenue. Our fee is $Z. So you're up $Y minus $Z.
>
> And here's the thing – 20% is actually conservative. Most clients see 30-50% improvement because their data was so bad before.
>
> The question isn't whether you can afford AdVocate. It's whether you can afford to keep running ads without it."

---

### "I don't have time to set this up"

> "Total setup time is about 10 minutes. You install a plugin – literally click 'upload' and 'activate' – connect your Google Ads account with a few clicks, and you're done.
>
> From there, it runs itself. The whole point is that you DON'T have to babysit it. The system handles the optimization automatically. You just check in once a week to see how much money it saved you."

---

### "How do I know this actually works?"

> "Great question. Three ways:
>
> 1. **You'll see it in Google Ads.** Within a few weeks, you'll see 'offline conversions' appearing in your campaigns with actual dollar values attached. That proves the data is flowing.
>
> 2. **Your numbers will change.** Track your cost per lead or cost per customer before and after. Most clients see 30-50% improvement within 90 days.
>
> 3. **We have case studies.** [Reference relevant case study for their vertical.]
>
> But honestly? The best proof is trying it. We have a 30-day trial – if you don't see improvement, you don't pay."

---

### "We're too small / not ready"

> "Actually, smaller businesses often see the BIGGEST improvement because there's more low-hanging fruit.
>
> Think about it: A Fortune 500 company has a team of analysts optimizing their data. You don't. That's not a criticism – it's just reality. AdVocate gives you that capability without the headcount.
>
> If you're spending at least $500/month on ads, you'll see ROI from this. And the sooner you start, the sooner Google starts learning what makes you money."

---

### "I need to think about it"

> "Totally understand. What specifically do you want to think about? Is it the price, the timing, or something about how it works?
>
> *[Listen and address the real objection]*
>
> Here's something to consider: Every day your ads run without this data, Google is learning the wrong lessons. The leads you close this month could be training your ads to find better customers next month – but only if that data makes it back to Google.
>
> What would help you feel confident moving forward?"

---

### "What if it breaks something?"

> "Great question – you should be careful with your ads. Here's the thing: AdVocate doesn't touch your campaign structure, your bids, or your ads. All we do is SEND data TO Google – specifically, which conversions were actually valuable.
>
> It's additive, not destructive. Google takes that data and gets smarter. If for some reason you wanted to stop, just deactivate the plugin – your campaigns keep running exactly as they were.
>
> There's no lock-in and no risk to your existing setup."

## Demo Script

### Setup (2 minutes)

> "Let me show you exactly how AdVocate works. I'm going to walk you through the same thing your leads experience, and then show you what happens behind the scenes."

### Part 1: The Click (3 minutes)

> "Imagine someone searches for '[their service] near me' and clicks your ad. Watch this URL..."
>
> *[Show URL with GCLID parameter]*
>
> "See that long code at the end? That's Google's tracking ID. It tells Google exactly which keyword, which ad, which campaign drove this click.
>
> Most businesses lose this information the moment the person fills out a form. It just... disappears.
>
> AdVocate captures it and attaches it to everything this person does."

### Part 2: The Lead (3 minutes)

> "Now they fill out your form. Watch what happens in the AdVocate dashboard..."
>
> *[Show lead being created with all tracking data]*
>
> "See? We know exactly where they came from. The keyword, the ad, the campaign, the landing page. All connected to this lead.
>
> We also start scoring them automatically based on signals – what pages they viewed, how long they spent, which form they used."

### Part 3: The Sync (3 minutes)

> "Here's where the magic happens. Let's say this lead becomes a customer next week – a $10,000 case.
>
> You update their status to 'Won' and enter the value. Watch Google Ads..."
>
> *[Show conversion uploading to Google Ads]*
>
> "Boom. Google now knows that this specific click, from this specific keyword, generated $10,000 in revenue. And it adjusts its algorithm to find more people like this.
>
> This happens automatically, every day. You don't have to do anything."

### Part 4: The Results (3 minutes)

> "Over time, here's what you see..."
>
> *[Show data integrity score, lead value trends, optimization actions]*
>
> "Your Data Integrity Score shows how clean your tracking is. Yours is at 87% – that's good. Most businesses are at 20-30% before AdVocate.
>
> You can see which keywords drive actual revenue, not just clicks. This one looks good on paper – lots of clicks, low cost – but look, zero revenue. This one costs more per click but drives your best customers.
>
> That's the insight that changes everything."

### Close (2 minutes)

> "Any questions about how it works?
>
> *[Answer questions]*
>
> So here's what I recommend: Let's get this installed on your site this week. Setup takes about 10 minutes. We'll connect your Google Ads account and start collecting data.
>
> Within 2-3 weeks, you'll start seeing offline conversions appear in Google Ads. Within 90 days, you should see measurable improvement in your cost per customer.
>
> What does your calendar look like Thursday to get this set up?"

## Closing Techniques

### The ROI Close

> "Let's do quick math. You're spending $3,000/month on ads. If we improve results by just 30%, that's like getting an extra $900/month in value. AdVocate costs $200. You're up $700/month – and that's the conservative estimate.
>
> The only way this doesn't make sense is if you don't believe better data leads to better results. Do you?"

### The Risk Reversal Close

> "Here's what I'll do. Let's set this up today. Give it 30 days. If you don't see offline conversions flowing into Google Ads, if you don't see your data integrity improve, I'll refund you completely.
>
> The only thing you're risking is 10 minutes of setup time. The upside is 30-50% better ad performance. Fair?"

### The Urgency Close

> "Here's the thing about machine learning: it needs data to learn. Every day your ads run without this feedback, they're learning the wrong lessons – or not learning at all.
>
> The leads you close this month could be training your ads to find better customers next month. But only if that data makes it back to Google.
>
> What would it take to get this set up this week?"

### The Assumptive Close

> "Alright, it sounds like this is a good fit. Let's get you set up. I have time Thursday at 2pm for a quick install call – we'll have you live in 10 minutes. Does that work for your schedule?"
