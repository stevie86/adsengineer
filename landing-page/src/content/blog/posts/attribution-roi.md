# How Better Attribution Data Can 3x Your Marketing ROI

## The Attribution Blind Spot

Most businesses are flying blind when it comes to marketing attribution. They know they spend money on ads, they know they get customers, but they can't reliably connect the two.

**The result:** Poor budget allocation, wasted ad spend, and missed growth opportunities.

## The ROI Impact of Good Attribution

### Case Study: Local Dental Practice

**Before:** Manual tracking, estimated attribution
- Monthly ad spend: €3,000
- Estimated CPA: €75
- Actual conversions tracked: 60%

**After:** Server-side attribution with AdsEngineer
- Monthly ad spend: €3,000 (same)
- Actual CPA: €45 (-40%)
- Conversions tracked: 95% (+58%)
- Additional revenue: €1,800/month

**ROI Improvement:** 2.3x better attribution accuracy = €1,800 additional monthly revenue

### Case Study: E-commerce Store

**Before:** Pixel-based tracking, frequent data loss
- Monthly ad spend: €8,000
- Conversion tracking: 40% accuracy
- Lost attribution: €3,200/month in untracked revenue

**After:** Server-side attribution
- Monthly ad spend: €8,000
- Conversion tracking: 98% accuracy
- Lost attribution: €160/month (-95%)
- Better optimization: 25% lower CPA

**ROI Improvement:** €3,040 monthly savings + better campaign performance

## The Compound Effect

Good attribution data creates a flywheel effect:

1. **Accurate tracking** reveals which campaigns work
2. **Better optimization** improves performance
3. **Lower CPAs** allow more ad spend
4. **More conversions** provide better data
5. **Repeat cycle** with compounding improvements
