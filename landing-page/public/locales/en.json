    "q1Text": "Yes. Two options: (1) Paste our script like Google Tag Manager — works instantly on any site without backend changes. (2) Full server-side integration — direct backend connection for maximum control and performance. Works with WordPress, Shopify, Shopware, WooCommerce, Webflow — anything.",
    "q2Title": "Do I need to be technical to set this up?",
    "q2Text": "No. For WordPress and Shopify, we have plugins — just install and activate. For custom sites, it's one line of JavaScript. We handle the technical setup on our end.",
    "q3Title": "Is this GDPR compliant?",
    "q3Text": "Yes. We use first-party data collection. Data never leaves your infrastructure until you decide where to send it. EU data stays in EU. No third-party cookies required.",
    "q4Title": "How long does setup take?",
    "q4Text": "5 minutes for WordPress/Shopify. 30 minutes for custom implementations. Most businesses are tracking accurately within an hour of signing up.",
    "q5Title": "What if I'm not losing data?",
    "q5Text": "Run our free data loss audit. We'll show you exactly how much data you're missing. If you're not losing data, we'll tell you — no charge.",
    "q6Title": "What is server-side tracking?",
    "q6Text": "Traditional tracking sends data from the user's browser to your analytics tools. Server-side tracking sends data from your website's server instead. This means ad blockers can't stop it, and it bypasses browser privacy restrictions.",
    "q7Title": "What are first-party and third-party cookies?",
    "q7Text": "First-party cookies are set by the website you're visiting. Third-party cookies are set by other websites (like Facebook or Google) to track you across the internet. Browsers block third-party cookies but allow first-party cookies.",
    "q8Title": "What's iOS App Tracking Transparency?",
    "q8Text": "A privacy feature Apple released in April 2021. Every iPhone app must ask you: \"Allow this app to track your activity across other apps and websites?\" 40% of users say \"no\" — breaking your analytics for all iPhone traffic.",
    "q9Title": "What is Safari ITP?",
    "q9Text": "Intelligent Tracking Prevention is Safari's privacy feature that completely blocks third-party cookies. Safari does this to protect your privacy, but it breaks your marketing analytics unless you work around it.",
    "q10Title": "What is GDPR?",
    "q10Text": "General Data Protection Regulation. European law that requires businesses to get user consent before tracking. Most users decline the consent banner, reducing your data by 60-80%."
